The correct way to handle this is to use the `onAuthStateChanged` listener to ensure that the user is authenticated before accessing their data:

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in, see docs for a list of available properties
    // https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.User
    const uid = user.uid;
    console.log('User is signed in:', uid);
    // ... access user data here ...
  } else {
    // User is signed out
    console.log('User is signed out');
    // ... handle user sign-out ...
  }
});

// Existing authentication calls remain unchanged.
firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle error
  });
```
This ensures that any code relying on user information executes only after the `onAuthStateChanged` listener confirms authentication.
