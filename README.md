# Firebase Authentication Listener Delay Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener:  it doesn't always trigger immediately after authentication. This can lead to unexpected behavior in code that depends on the authenticated user's data.

The `authBug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `authBugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct way to handle the listener delay using the listener itself to get the user data after authentication is complete.

## Reproducing the Bug

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Set up a Firebase project and install the Firebase SDK.
3.  Replace placeholders in the code with your Firebase configuration.
4.  Run `authBug.js` and observe the behavior.
5.  Run `authBugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `onAuthStateChanged` listener to reliably access the authenticated user's data *after* authentication completes. Avoid directly accessing user data immediately after calling `signInWithEmailAndPassword` or similar methods.
